# Neural_Network_Charity_Analysis

## OVERVIEW

The purpose of this project is to utilize knowledge of machine learning and neural networks to create a Binary classifier that is capable of predicting whether applicants will be successful if funded by Alphabet Soup. This project will be using deep=learning neural networks with TensorFlow. 

## RESULTS

### Data Preprocessing
What variable(s) are considered the target(s) for your model?

* The column "is_successful" would be considered the target for the model.

What variable(s) are considered to be the features for your model?

* The features affilation, classification, use_case. organization, status, and application are some but not all variables that would be considered features for the model 


What variable(s) are neither targets nor features, and should be removed from the input data?

* The features 'ein' and 'name' were both considered neither targets nor features, and were removed from the data

 
 ### Compiling, Training, and Evaluating the Model

I added one extra layer to the model. The target model performance was not achieved.

## Summary

Using a deep learning neural network model would take a long time to achieve the target accuracy. The more dense the data is, the more time it would take and less chance of accuracy. I would suggest a different machine learning model to perform quicker and more accurately. If not, the project will take days, or even months depending on time spent.
